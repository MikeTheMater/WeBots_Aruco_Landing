This is the project made for the Thesis with subject "Collision detection and avoidance for unmanned aerial vehicles and landing site detection using computational geometry and computer vision".
Simulation of UAVs and development of a collision detection and avoidance algorithm using geometric computation and camera input for landing-site detection in the Webots simulator with Python. A computational-geometry approach with dynamic, velocity-scaled bounding boxes was implemented to predict future positions and proactively detect potential collisions between UAVs, while the camera feed is used to identify an ArUco marker that’s used as a landing location. The avoidance strategy combines vertical and horizontal maneuvers to ensure safe separation and flight stabilization.
This method was created to try and avoid the collision in a situation where the drones fly very close.
