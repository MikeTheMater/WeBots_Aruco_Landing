This is the project made for the Thesis with subject "Collision detection and avoidance for unmanned aerial vehicles and landing site detection using computational geometry and computer vision".
The main concept is the detection of collisions using the extended bounding box of the drone and using simple movement to prevent and avoid the collision in a situation where the drones fly very close.
The text of the Thesis written in LaTex is in this github repo: https://github.com/MikeTheMater/Thesis
